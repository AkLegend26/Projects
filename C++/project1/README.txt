2. It should take about 3-5 hours to complete this assignment.
3. It took me about 9 hours to complete this assignment.
4. Reading up about the partially filled array and traversing an array took a while but it wasn’t impeding.
5. What I didn’t like was that later methods had almost similar loops with the body and got repetitive. 
   What I enjoyed was being able to debug my own code to fix errors.
6. My recommendations would be to talk about traversing an array in c++ terms. 
   But, I am assuming it was the goal of the project to teach it to us. 
   For me, the logic was there, but the implementation took a while because it could’ve been done a lot easier in python for me(chaining test).
   But, looking back it’s not a big difference.
