1. Ayush Pathak        
2. Around 6-7 hours
3. Around 6 hours
4. Only making merge cal linear took a thought but after laying the code on a piece of paper it worked.
5. I hated creating new test cases, can never be too certain if its correct. Enjoyed playing with pointers in the program.
6. This assignment was a really good introduction to pointers, not too much, and not too little. Maybe if there could be one or two more functions to implement.
