2. Approximately 7 hours
3. Approximately 5 hours
4. The guide or the project sheet had everything needed.
5. Final test was to reverse the message file and hear the 
   reversed audio for the message, other files provided were also tested.
6. To check the  stack implementation, test cases were designed 
   in a designated .cpp file, to make sure every element is pushed to 
   the top of the stack.
7. To Infinity and Beyond!
8. Enjoyed listening to the reversed music files and hearing the hidden message. 
   Hated the fact that the reversed original audio file didn’t have a meaning in a
   different language.
9. I would’ve said instructions but it was clearly stated that instructions can be hard
   to comprehend and if needed help should be seeked. So none.
